## Выделение текста

Hello, world!

The *italics* characters of Salinger's works were made in the year of the publication of the exact edition. *To make some italics there are two asterisks in the beginning and the end of* the conversed symbols.

**Bold** is made with doubled alpha and omega's asteriks.

~~There is no place for negativity but tildas can be optimal for versions control.~~
